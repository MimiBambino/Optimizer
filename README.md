Optimization Project for Front End Nanodegree

The project is a mock portfolio landing page with several featured works, including a pizza retaurant website.
The pizza website uses many different resource intensive methods which originally caused the page to render 
slowly and scroll slowly.  

I utilized a number of website optimization techniques.  Among these were reducing the number of DOM calls in 
the associated javascript file, inlining all CSS, removing all unused CSS and minifying the javascript file 
that is used to create the pizza restaurant page. The unminified version of the file is main.js.  It is entirely 
the same as the minified version.

I referenced many resources for this project including the following:
